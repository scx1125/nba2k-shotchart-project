## What is this?
This is a hack template coded in C++ that will help you make internal hacks(or really any code that reads/writes to a process).

## Requirements
I included D3D9 and detours, if you don't want to use them you will need to do some changes to the code.

## Code Example/Documentation
Main.cpp should already be a good starting point, also the code isn't that big so you probably can use all it provides within 10 minutes of reading it.

## To-Do
- Make it usable on external
